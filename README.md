# WordClouds grouped by country

The goal of this project is to conduct WordClouds visualization about USF MSDS students' feelings toward our program grouped by country from the data of a survey

Details of code is covered in the `wordcloud_viz.ipynb` notebook. 

Triky part is how to mask the wordcloud into the shape we want. In our case it is masking WordClouds into country boarder that counts.
